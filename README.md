## Heroku Cedar Stack images

This repository holds recipes for building the [Heroku Cedar stack images](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar). The recipes are also rendered into Docker images that are [available on Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/heroku/cedar/). [Lists of packages installed on the current Cedar stacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar-ubuntu-packages) are published on Heroku Dev Center.

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for instructions on how to build the images yourself.
